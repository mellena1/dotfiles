# dotfiles

My very boring dotfiles

My general setup:
- Nvim as the editor
- Hyprland for my linux window manager
- Ghostty as my terminal of choice
- Zsh for my shell with oh-my-zsh for theming/plugins

Setup based on [this great article](https://venthur.de/2021-12-19-managing-dotfiles-with-stow.html)
